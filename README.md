wikigrok-proto
==============

As a new/casual user, I want to have a quick, easy way to add information to Wikipedia, so I feel empowered by knowing I have something valuable to contribute (and maybe get interested in contributing more).

As a mobile team, I want new/casual users to add more metadata to Wikipedia topics, so they have a valuable and easy way to contribute to Wikipedia and we enrich the structured data repo of Wikimedia projects.

This prototype app was developed using [MeteorJS](http://meteor.com) and can be viewed at http://wikigrok-proto.meteor.com.
